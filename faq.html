		<h2>What is Working in Widener?</h2>
		<p>It's an educational game. You assume the role of a shelver working in Harvard's Widener Library. You are assigned five books to shelve and asked to find their places in the stacks using their call numbers. The faster the better.</p>
		<h2>A multiplayer game?</h2>
		<p>Yes, you can play another person. Up to two players. (Many two player games can be played at one time.) You can also play in single player mode. If you go this route, you're racing against the clock.</p>
		<h2>How do I find an opponent?</h2>
		<p>Working in Widener will pair two players up. So, load the game, choose <i>two player</i> and wait. When a second player does the same you'll be racing against each other. If you're waiting a while, email a buddy and tell them to join you or play in single player mode.</p>
		<h2>Is this really Widener Library?</h2>
		<p>Yes, but we simplified Widener. We sliced four floors out of Widener and reduced the number of shelves on each level. The floor plan is close to what you'll find in the physical world, the call number locations too.</p>
		<h2>Does each shelver get the same books?</h2>
		<p>Books are randomly chosen for each game. If you're playing in two player mode, you each get the same set of books, but we shuffle them in different orders.</p>
		<h2>Is this real book data?</h2>
		<p>Yes. Book data is loaded from the Harvard catalog using the <a href="http://librarycloud.harvard.edu">LibraryCloud API</a></p>
		<h2>Is my time good?</h2>
		<p>Hopefully. See how you stack up against other players by looking at <a href="top-scores.html">the Top Scores page.</a></p>
		<h2>This game is cool. How did you build it?</h2>
		<p>It's mostly JavaScript leveraging the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> technologies. A big thanks to those folks for building a sharing.</p>
		<h2>Can I get this for my library?</h2>
		<p>Yes! Our source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/working-in-widener">github</a>. Drop <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/about.html">us</a> a note and let us know if you have something to share.</p>
